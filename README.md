## About the Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "Pomodoros", named after the Italian word for tomato, as Cirillo originally used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to track his work intervals.

## Features

- Set a timer for 25 minutes, the standard Pomodoro duration.
- Start, pause, and reset the timer.
- Visual indication of time remaining.
- Audio alert when the timer completes a Pomodoro session.
